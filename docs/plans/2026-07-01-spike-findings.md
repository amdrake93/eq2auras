# Spike Findings — ACT API reconnaissance + live behaviour

> **PHASE 0 COMPLETE (2026-07-01).** Final demo: token saved (DPAPI) → one click of "Check for updates" → both DLLs downloaded from the private `dev-latest` release, swapped in place, plugin self-reloaded live → crimson box + `core=D`. The entire dev loop (Mac edit → CI → self-update in ACT) is one button. Remaining passives: `WarningValue` distribution gathering; scan-safety structural decision for the feature plan.

Running record of what we've confirmed about ACT's timer system. Sources: `[decompiled]` = read from `ThirdParty/Advanced Combat Tracker.exe` via `ilspycmd` on the Mac (Task 1.5); `[live]` = observed in a running ACT (Task 6 / Task 8) — pending.

## API shapes (Task 1.5, `[decompiled]` from ACT 2.5MB assembly)

- **`SpellTimer.TimeLeft` is `int`** (whole seconds), computed as
  `TimerFinalDuration - Convert.ToInt32((LastEstimatedTime - startTime).TotalSeconds)` — **no clamp, so it goes negative after expiry.** This resolves a spec `[U]`: overdue count-up can read `−TimeLeft` directly. (Drove `TimerSnapshotRecord.TimeLeft` → `int?`, null = no live timer.)
- **`TimerData.RemoveValue` defaults to `-15`** — ACT's removal threshold is ~15s past zero. Resolves part of the `RemoveValue` `[U]` (still confirm the exact drop moment in `GetTimerFrames()` live).
- **`FormSpellTimers.GetTimerFrames()` → `List<TimerFrame>`** (and a `GetTimerFrames(int PanelNum)` overload; the no-arg calls panel 0).
- **Events** `OnSpellTimerNotify/Warning/Expire/Removed` are `event SpellTimerEventDelegate`, invoked as `handler(TimerFrame)` — handler signature is **`void (TimerFrame)`**.
- **`TimerFrame`**: `TimerData TimerData {get;set;}`, `string Combatant {get;set;}`, `List<SpellTimer> SpellTimers {get;set;}`, `string Name => TimerData.Name`, `int WarningValue => TimerData.WarningValue`, `int[] TimerVals`, `bool RadialDisplay`. (`Name` dereferences `TimerData`, which the constructor always sets — non-null in practice.)
- **`TimerData`**: `int WarningValue` (default 10), `int TimerValue` (default 30), `Color FillColor` (default `Blue`), `string Category`, `int RemoveValue` (default -15), `bool RadialDisplay`.
- **`SpellTimer`**: `DateTime StartTime`, `int TimerFinalDuration` (post-mod), `int TimeLeft`.

All member names/types the plan's `TimerProbe` assumes are confirmed (only `TimeLeft`'s type differed — was `double` in the draft, corrected to `int`).

## Bitness (Task 1.5, informational only)

`file` reports `PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386 Mono/.Net assembly`. For a managed AnyCPU exe the PE32 header is not conclusive, but a **separate `ACTx86.exe` ships alongside** the main exe, which indicates the main `Advanced Combat Tracker.exe` is the AnyCPU/64-bit build. **This gates no code** — overlay click-through uses the int `GetWindowLong`/`SetWindowLong` exports, correct on both bitnesses.

## Build / CI (Task 3, confirmed in the cloud)

- **SDK-style WPF on `net472` compiles in GitHub Actions** (run `28546103013`) — the XAML `MarkupCompilePass` runs and succeeds. **The legacy-csproj fallback (Task 3 Step 4) is NOT needed.** The #1 project-format risk is retired.
- **`System.Web.Extensions` breaks the WPF XAML markup compiler** (run `28545971312`): it drags in `System.Web`, which the markup compiler's metadata assembly-resolver can't resolve → `Could not find assembly 'System.Web…'`. **Consequence for Task 9:** the self-updater must **not** use `System.Web.Extensions`/`JavaScriptSerializer` for JSON. Parse the GitHub API response another way (e.g. `DataContractJsonSerializer` from `System.Runtime.Serialization`, or minimal hand-parsing) — anything that avoids pulling `System.Web` into a project that also does WPF markup compilation.
- `dotnet test` of the net10.0 Core tests runs green on `windows-latest` too (via `actions/setup-dotnet@v4` `10.0.x`).

## Live behaviour (Task 4 / 6 / 7 / 8)

Confirmed live in ACT:
- [x] **Plugin loads** (`eq2auras.dll` Browse-added) and `InitPlugin` runs fully — log dir + logger + probe + overlay all initialize. `Core.dll` (netstandard2.0) loads in ACT's .NET Framework host **without** a facade/binding-redirect problem — the netstandard worry is retired.
- [x] **WPF renders inside ACT**: transparent layered window on a dedicated STA thread + Dispatcher, with storyboard animation (pulsing box), live. Dedicated-STA thread model works — no ACT-UI-thread fallback needed.
- [x] Root cause of the earlier "core threw an error": `eq2auras.Core.dll` was Browse-added as a plugin (it's a dependency, not an `IActPluginV1`). Add only `eq2auras.dll`.

- [x] **Dependency resolution gotcha (fixed).** A timer firing threw `Could not load file or assembly 'eq2auras.Core' … cannot find the file`, spammed every poll. Cause: `Core.dll` is in the Plugins folder but ACT **does not probe the Plugins folder for a plugin's dependencies** — strong evidence ACT loads the plugin from **raw bytes** (no file location → CLR searches only ACT's app dir + GAC). `InitPlugin`/box worked because they touch no `Core` type; the failure only hit when `LogFrame` first used `TimerSnapshotRecord`. **Fix:** `PluginAssemblyResolver` registers `AppDomain.AssemblyResolve` (first line of `InitPlugin`) to `LoadFrom` our deps in the Plugins folder.
  - **Bonus for Task 8:** ACT loading plugins from bytes is the exact precondition under which the overwrite-file + toggle-`cbEnabled` reload can run *new* bytes. Encouraging sign for live self-update, still to be confirmed.

Still pending:
- [x] **Click-through confirmed** — clicks pass through the box to the game behind it (WS_EX_LAYERED|WS_EX_TRANSPARENT works).
- [ ] **Clean teardown** — disable the plugin: box vanishes, no error; re-enable: returns. (Implicitly exercised during testing; confirm explicitly.)
- [x] **Live timer data captured** (`spike-20260701-192959.jsonl`, timer `Holy Shield` warn=10 total=30):
  - **`timeLeft` goes negative** — `30→…→0→−1` confirms the decompiled `duration − elapsed` (no clamp).
  - **`warning` fires at `tL=10`** (= `warningValue`), **`expire` at `tL=0`**.
  - **Reset observed** — `timeLeft` jumped back to `30` on re-fire (ability fired again). Reset = jump toward `total`.
- [x] **Removal timing measured — and it CONTRADICTS the `-15` expectation.** Three clean untouched lifecycles, all identical: `30/notify → … → 10/warning → … → 0/expire → −1 → removed`. **The frame vanishes ~1s after zero, not ~15s** — `TimerData.RemoveValue = -15` does not govern frame lifetime for a standard trigger timer. The `removed` event fires with an already-empty `SpellTimers` list (`timeLeft=null`). **Design consequence: the Overdue state gets ~1s of ACT data; the spec's minimum-display floor is the entire mechanism carrying the LATE alert, not a polish item.**
- [x] **Logging is real-time** — poll cadence median 109 ms (min 95 / max 124) vs the 100 ms target, measured from record `ts` deltas across 853 polls.
- [ ] **`WarningValue` distribution** — only one timer type observed; needs more variety. Non-blocking; gather passively during normal play.

### ⚠ SCAN-SAFETY RULE (Task 9 regression, root-caused)
ACT's plugin scan (`Assembly.GetTypes()`, to find `IActPluginV1`) runs **before `InitPlugin`** — i.e. before our `AssemblyResolve` handler exists. The scan resolves the types of the assembly's **fields** — and **`async` methods hoist awaited locals into fields of hidden state-machine structs**. Task 9's async `SelfUpdater` hoisted a `ReleaseManifest` (Core) local → scan demanded `eq2auras.Core.dll` → "cannot find the file" + "assembly does not implement ACT's plugin interface". The gold build only worked because its fields happened to be Core-free (Core types in method signatures/bodies resolve lazily at JIT, after the resolver is registered).
**Rule: no Core/non-GAC types in ANY field of the plugin assembly — including compiler-generated state machines (no `async`) and closures.** Fix applied: SelfUpdater rewritten sync-over-async.
**Feature-plan input:** this constraint is fragile for real feature code (view-models etc. will want Core-typed fields). The feature plan should pick a structural fix: ILRepack Core into the plugin, or drop `Core.dll` beside ACT's exe (app-base probing works at scan time), or keep the field discipline.

### Design inputs for the NEXT (feature) plan — surfaced by two near-simultaneous triggers of the same timer
- **Identity key `(Name, Combatant)` is insufficient when `combatant="none"`** (timer not tied to a caster/target) — two concurrent instances become indistinguishable. The real overlay needs a per-instance key.
- **Concurrent instances share ONE `TimerFrame`** — `TimerFrame.SpellTimers` is a `List`; the probe logs only `[0]`, losing the others (seen as `8→7→8` flicker and odd `removed tL=2/1`). The overlay must iterate all `SpellTimers`, not just `[0]`.

### Minor bug fixed
- Log had a **UTF-8 BOM** (`StreamWriter(..., Encoding.UTF8)`) → JSONL parse needed `utf-8-sig`. Fixed to `new UTF8Encoding(false)` (BOM-less).
- [x] **Reload verdict (Task 8) — LIVE RELOAD WORKS.** The orange-build test (overwrite DLL in place → toggle the EXISTING entry's Enabled checkbox) ran the **new bytes without an ACT restart**: green box → disable (box gone, clean teardown) → enable → ACT's own **unblock prompt** (proof the enable path re-reads the file from disk) → **orange box**. Sub-verdicts:
  - **No file lock** — the DLL overwrote cleanly while the plugin was enabled (byte-loading confirmed).
  - **WPF payload live-reloads fine** — the spec's WPF↔live-reload tension is dissolved: ACT does the byte-loading, we never call `Assembly.Load(byte[])` ourselves.
  - **Unchanged `Core.dll` resolves across reload** ✅. The **changed-Core** case then failed harder than predicted: **`Assembly.LoadFrom` LOCKS the dependency file for the process lifetime** — `Core.dll` couldn't even be overwritten while ACT ran (while `eq2auras.dll`, byte-loaded by ACT, replaced freely — the asymmetry was the diagnosis). **Fix: the resolver byte-loads (`Assembly.Load(File.ReadAllBytes)`)** — no lock, no path-cache (fresh Core per reload; per-assembly-instance cache prevents duplicate loads), and byte arrays carry no mark-of-the-web so Core needs no unblocking. **One-time cost:** the running session's old resolver holds the lock until ACT exits → the byte-loading build must be installed via a full ACT restart; thereafter two-DLL live updates should work.
  - **Round-3 verdict (marker C, gold build): TWO-DLL LIVE UPDATE FULLY PROVEN.** With ACT running: both DLLs overwrote cleanly (no Core lock — byte-loading fix confirmed), toggle → **gold box + `core=C`** — fresh plugin *and* fresh Core executing, no restart. ACT's built-in unblock prompt covered the plugin DLL; byte-loaded Core needs no unblock. **Task 8 closed. Task 9 self-update = download both → overwrite both → toggle `cbEnabled` → live.**
  - The earlier *"duplicate plugin found… restart ACT"* was only about **Browse-adding a second list entry** — a different code path; verdict corrected.
  - ⇒ **Task 9 self-update = full ACT_Adder pattern: download → overwrite → toggle own `cbEnabled` → live.** No restart prompt needed (except possibly for Core changes, pending the test above).
  - Minor: each reload stacks a new `AssemblyResolve` handler (fresh statics per assembly instance) — fixed by unregistering in `DeInitPlugin`.
- [x] **Green build loads after ACT restart** (confirms the restart-to-update path) and **a timer counting down no longer throws** — the `AssemblyResolve` fix is verified live. Dependency-resolution bug closed.
