# eq2auras — Design Spec

**A personal ACT overlay suite for EverQuest 2.** This document is the source of truth for what eq2auras is and how it works. It is organized as: the suite vision and architecture (Part I), then the Phase 1 feature — the Timer Overlay — in full (Part II), then cross-cutting concerns, unknowns, and the roadmap (Part III).

Status: **live and iterating.** The timer overlay is shipped and guild-verified through slice 3 (escalation, knob model, palette colors). Present-tense descriptions below describe the system as designed; anything not yet built is scoped to a phase or the roadmap.

---

## Part I — The Suite

### Vision

The north star is *"WeakAuras for EQ2"*: a framework that lets a player build configurable, good-looking combat overlays, hosted in one place. WeakAuras is beloved because it is a *construction kit* — many "auras" on one engine — not a fixed window. EQ2 has nothing comparable. eq2auras aims there, built incrementally.

### The one hard constraint: ACT owns the data

eq2auras is an **ACT plugin that reads ACT's live data and renders its own UI**. It does **not** reimplement triggers, timers, or log parsing. Triggers and spell timers stay in ACT's native framework, which matters because the team already shares timer configurations through ACT's built-in sharing system — a teammate who does not run eq2auras still receives and uses those timers normally. eq2auras owns *presentation only*.

### Architecture: shared core + feature modules

The suite is deliberately layered so that each new overlay idea is a module on common plumbing, not a new project:

- **Core (reusable, feature-agnostic):**
  - Overlay window framework — a transparent, top-most, click-through window.
  - The render loop.
  - Rendering primitives — bars, text, radial/pie, free positioning — and the escalation/conditions engine that maps *state → appearance*.
  - Configuration.
  - Diagnostic logging.
- **ACT data adapters (feature-specific, thin):** small layers that pull from ACT and normalize into the core's model. The *timer adapter* (Phase 1) reads `FormSpellTimers.GetTimerFrames()`; a future *encounter adapter* reads combatant/DPS data.
- **Feature modules:** built on the core.
  - **Timer Overlay** — Phase 1 (this spec, Part II).
  - **Parse Meter** — future (replacement for ACT's "mini parse" names/DPS window). Different data source, same core plumbing — this module is the reason the core is kept feature-agnostic.

### Packaging

Ships as a **single ACT plugin** — one `.dll` dropped into ACT's `Plugins` folder. The `Core` project's sources are **compiled directly into the plugin assembly** (shared source via `<Compile Include>`), not shipped as a second DLL: ACT's plugin scan (`Assembly.GetTypes()`, which runs *before* `InitPlugin`) resolves the types of every field in the assembly — including compiler-generated async state machines — so all types the plugin's fields can mention must live in the plugin assembly itself or the GAC. Single-assembly packaging makes that hold by construction (no `AssemblyResolve` shim, no ILRepack, one-file self-update). The `Core` project still exists as a `netstandard2.0` build of the same sources for Mac-side `dotnet test`. Features are individually toggleable, so a teammate can install the package and enable only what they want.

**Core stays the suite's shared plumbing at the source level.** If the suite later splits into sibling plugins (e.g. a standalone Parse Meter), each plugin compiles the same Core sources into itself — shared development, self-contained binaries. That also sidesteps the DLL-hell a shared `Core.dll` would create between independently-updating plugins: each plugin ships the Core it was built and tested with.

### Platform facts

- **.NET Framework 4.x** class library. ACT is a .NET Framework host; .NET Core / 5+ assemblies will not load.
- Plugin entry point: `Advanced_Combat_Tracker.IActPluginV1` (`InitPlugin(TabPage, Label)` / `DeInitPlugin()`).
- The overlay renders over **borderless-windowed** EQ2. It cannot draw over true exclusive-fullscreen Direct3D — a documented limitation that applies to ACT's own overlays too, and rarely a problem in practice (Win10+ usually runs "fullscreen" as borderless).
- **Teardown matters.** ACT loads and *reloads* plugins at runtime, so `DeInitPlugin()` must stop the render loop, unsubscribe every ACT event, close the overlay window, and flush/close the diagnostic log. Leaked windows, timers, and event subscriptions are a known ACT-plugin failure class.

---

## Part II — Phase 1: The Timer Overlay

### Goal

Replace ACT's cramped, static spell-timer window with a **calm, glanceable list of upcoming timers that escalates each timer as it approaches its moment** — so salience tracks urgency instead of everything looking the same. This is the concrete pain being solved: ACT's window treats a 40-seconds-away timer identically to a 3-seconds-away one, in the same cramped spot off to the side.

Phase 1 ships the **general engine with a single baked-in preset** (constants), not a configuration editor. The escalation behavior is expressed as condition values that happen to be fixed constants for now; adding configuration later is *exposing knobs that already exist internally*, not a rewrite.

### The core loop

Everything is one loop, run on a **poll/state tick** (target ~15–30 fps):

> **read timer data → route to timer groups → derive each timer's state per group → update the view model (and emit diagnostics)**

Each tick reads `ActGlobals.oFormSpellTimers.GetTimerFrames()` (a `List<TimerFrame>`) for a smooth live countdown. The tick updates *state*, not pixels — WPF animates at display refresh off that state — so this is a poll/state rate, not a manual draw rate. ACT's lifecycle events (`OnSpellTimerNotify` / `Warning` / `Expire` / `Removed`, each handing us the whole `TimerFrame`) are available and may be used for precise transition moments, but polling covers Phase 1.

### Timer groups: N instances of one pipeline

The overlay is organized as **timer groups**. A group is a complete, independent instance of the escalation pipeline described in this Part — its own calm list window, its own center escalation zone, its own knobs (`ColorSource`, `EscalationStyle`), and its own persisted window positions (§Moving the overlay). Everything below described in the singular ("the list", "the center zone") applies per group.

Each group has a **source**: a rule selecting which ACT timers feed it. The shipped configuration is **exactly two groups**, wired to the only routing data ACT exposes — the per-timer panel booleans (`TimerData.Panel1Display` / `Panel2Display`, set per timer in ACT's triggers window): **Panel A** (timers flagged for ACT panel 1) and **Panel B** (panel 2). In guild practice the panels carry semantics: A = fight/boss timers, B = personal cooldowns and buff durations.

Routing mirrors ACT exactly: a timer appears in every group whose source matches — flagged for both panels → both groups; flagged for neither → shown nowhere. `FormSpellTimers.AllowPanel2` is ignored: it governs ACT's native window, not ours. (Measured 2026-07-02: the no-arg `GetTimerFrames()` poll reports panel-2 timers, so routing needs only the per-reading booleans.)

In code, Core's `OverlayEngine` owns the whole multi-group policy: it builds one `EscalationTracker` per configured group (`Settings.Panels`), routes each tick's readings by source, and returns one frame per group. The plugin stays instantiator and data supplier — it reads ACT into readings and hosts a window pair per group. Group add/remove UI and richer sources (category, name match) are roadmap — the WeakAuras "N configurable groups" north star; growing there changes only the routing predicate, not the group model's shape.

The one deliberately global piece across groups is **color identity** — a single name→slot palette map (§Timer colors), so an ability keeps one color everywhere it appears, while each group still applies its own `ColorSource`.

### Rendering technology

Drawing the overlay is the hard part, and the choice drives whether the pulse/flash effects that *are* the feature come out smooth. On .NET Framework 4.x the realistic options:

- **WPF layered window** *(recommended)* — a borderless `Window` with `AllowsTransparency=true` (per-pixel alpha), `Topmost=true`, and click-through added via `WS_EX_LAYERED`/`WS_EX_TRANSPARENT` on its `HwndSource`. WPF's retained-mode compositor gives smooth alpha-blended pulse/fade/scale animation essentially for free — exactly what the escalation visuals need — and it hosts fine as a standalone window launched from the WinForms ACT plugin.
- **Transparent WinForms + GDI+** — the most common ACT-overlay precedent (Triggernometry), but `TransparencyKey` is 1-bit (no true per-pixel alpha); smooth alpha animation requires a hand-composited `UpdateLayeredWindow` bitmap — more code than WPF for a worse result.
- **Direct2D/SharpDX or CefSharp (HTML/CSS)** — maximum control or full CSS animation respectively, but each adds a heavyweight dependency out of proportion to Phase 1 (CefSharp bundles ~100+ MB of Chromium).

**Decision: WPF layered window**, validated in the spike (which opens a window anyway — it renders a pulsing test element over the game to confirm transparency, click-through, always-on-top over borderless EQ2, and animation smoothness before any real UI is built). Fall back to WinForms + `UpdateLayeredWindow` only if WPF interop inside ACT proves troublesome.

**WPF thread model (spike resolves):** WPF requires an **STA thread with a running `Dispatcher` message pump**. The overlay either runs on ACT's existing WinForms UI thread (already STA, shares the pump) or on a **dedicated STA thread with its own `Dispatcher.Run()`**. The choice governs how the poll/render tick marshals its per-tick snapshot onto the UI thread, so the spike (which opens a WPF test window anyway) settles the thread model up front.

**CEF/HTML is a deliberate future upgrade path, not just an alternative.** When the customization/authoring capabilities arrive (Phase 2+ — a config editor, per-element theming, import/export strings), web tech is the natural fit and the Chromium weight becomes justified. It is out of proportion for a Phase 1 timer overlay, so WPF starts; a later migration to CEF for the authoring era is anticipated, and the core's rendering-primitive boundary is meant to make that swap feasible.

### Concurrency with ACT's live data

`GetTimerFrames()` returns ACT's **live** `List<TimerFrame>`, mutated on ACT's own threads. Enumerating it from the render-loop thread risks an `InvalidOperationException` (*collection modified during enumeration*) — a classic ACT-plugin bug. Strategy: each tick, **snapshot** — copy the fields we need out of ACT's objects into our own immutable per-tick value objects as quickly as possible (defensively, tolerating concurrent mutation), then render exclusively from that snapshot; the render loop never touches ACT's live objects after the read. Whether the copy must be marshaled onto ACT's UI thread or guarded with a lock is one of the things the spike verifies against a live build.

### Data read from ACT (per timer, per tick)

From each `TimerFrame` and its `TimerData` definition + live `SpellTimer` instances:

| Field | Source | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `Name` | `TimerFrame.Name` / `TimerData.Name` | Label |
| caster | `TimerFrame.Combatant` | Disambiguation / per-target |
| `TimeLeft` | `SpellTimer.TimeLeft` (seconds; live) | The countdown; drives state |
| `TimerVals` | `TimerFrame.TimerVals` (sorted `int[]`) | Convenient pre-sorted remaining values |
| `WarningValue` | `TimerData.WarningValue` (seconds) | **The escalation threshold** — "how many seconds left is a warning" |
| `TimerValue` / `TimerFinalDuration` | def / instance | Total duration (post-mods) |
| `FillColor` | `TimerData.FillColor` | Element color (the only color ACT exposes) |
| `Category` | `TimerData.Category` | Grouping (future) |
| `RadialDisplay` | `TimerData` / `TimerFrame` | ACT's bar-vs-radial preference |
| `Panel1Display` / `Panel2Display` | `TimerData` | Group routing (§Timer groups) |

ACT exposes **no per-timer icon/image**, **no `CategoryData` object** (category is a bare string), and **no separate warning color** (only the threshold + an optional warning sound). Icons and per-category theming are therefore owned by eq2auras in later phases, not inherited.

### Escalation is driven by ACT's `WarningValue`

We do **not** invent thresholds. Each timer already carries its own `WarningValue` (the team sets it per-timer in ACT). Escalation pivots on it. This keeps Phase 1 honest with the "configuration in mind" principle — the threshold is real data we read.

**Escalation never relies on color alone.** A timer's display color is its *identity* (§Timer colors) — it may be anything from the palette, a user's own `FillColor` under `ActColor` mode, or deliberately non-distinctive under `Greyscale` — so it can never double as the urgency channel (a rose or crimson identity would false-signal against the Overdue red). Escalation is always carried by **size, position (into the center zone), motion/pulse, and the LATE tag**; color rides on top as identity, never as the signal.

### The timer lifecycle

Escalation state is derived from each timer's live `TimeLeft` versus its `WarningValue`, evaluated every tick. A timer is in one of three states:

1. **Calm** — `TimeLeft > WarningValue`. A row in the side **list**, auto-sorted soonest-to-expire, drawn as a horizontal bar (name + countdown + draining fill), colored by the timer's resolved display color (§Timer colors).
2. **Imminent** — `0 < TimeLeft ≤ WarningValue`. Presentation follows the **`EscalationStyle` knob**:
   - **`CenterRadial` (default, the brainstorm's Model A):** the timer is **removed from the list** (except on overflow — see §The center escalation zone) and promoted into the **center escalation zone** as a big pulsing radial pie. See the pie semantics and zone layout below.
   - **`HighlightInPlace` (Model C):** the timer **stays in the list**, escalated by its highlight outline — the same treatment overflow rows already get. The center zone stays unused for pies; overdue timers (linger-configured) render as LATE-styled rows in the list. (The original brainstorm explicitly kept both models available as configuration — this knob is that decision landing.)
3. **Overdue** — `TimeLeft ≤ 0` *while ACT still reports the timer*. The ability is *late* — a deterministic countdown is lost. Escalated further (see Overdue visual). **The overdue window is the timer's own `RemoveValue` config** — the same inherited-not-invented principle as `WarningValue`: a timer set to remove at 0 never shows an overdue state at all; a timer set to linger (negative `RemoveValue`) keeps being reported with negative `TimeLeft`, and LATE shows for exactly that configured window. Nothing on screen ever outlives the data.

**Transitions** follow `TimeLeft` directly: Calm → Imminent → Overdue as it decreases. When the ability fires, ACT resets the timer to full duration, so `TimeLeft` jumps back above `WarningValue` and the timer returns to **Calm** on the next tick. No special reset-detection is needed — a reset is simply a high `TimeLeft` reading.

**List motion (Phase 1).** Row entry, exit, and re-ordering — including the top→bottom jump when a timer resets to full — are **instantaneous**. Smoothing/animated reordering is deferred to a later phase.

**On state and removal.** Because Phase 1 respects ACT's removal, the overlay is close to a **stateless mirror** of `GetTimerFrames()`: presence, escalation, and de-escalation all fall out of the per-tick readings. The only cross-tick state is the identity key (below) and the session-stable palette map (§Timer colors) — bounded, and neither reintroduces the unbounded hold-until-reset model. (An earlier draft also carried an Overdue zero-crossing time and a minimum-display floor; the spike measured `TimeLeft` unclamped-negative and the floor was field-rejected — see §The Overdue visual — so neither exists.)

**Timer identity.** Threading each tick's readings into a per-timer sequence — needed for stable list ordering, display dedupe, and retained-visual reuse — keys on **`Name` + `Combatant`** (`TimerFrame.Name` + `TimerFrame.Combatant`); a `Name`-only key would wrongly collapse the same ability on two targets or from two casters into one entry. Measured limit: timers not bound to a caster report `Combatant = "none"`, so the key cannot distinguish two concurrent instances of the same timer — resolved by the **soonest-instance-governs** rule (one countdown per key: the soonest-expiring instance, matching ACT's native window — see §Resolved by the Phase-0 spike). Captured regex groups in `SpellTimer.ExtraInfo` might offer a finer per-instance key but remain unverified (*Still open*).

### The escalated radial pie — warning-window semantics

When a timer escalates to **Imminent**, the pie represents the **warning window, not the whole duration**:

- Fill fraction = `TimeLeft / WarningValue` (clamped to `[0,1]`).
- At the instant of escalation, `TimeLeft == WarningValue` → the pie is **full**; it drains to empty as `TimeLeft → 0`.

A 90s timer with a 10s warning escalates at 10s-left and gives a full, fast-draining pie for those last 10 seconds — rather than a barely-moving sliver of the whole 90s. The pie's motion is calibrated to the window that actually matters, which is easier to read at a glance. The pie shows a big seconds-left number and the timer name, tinted by the timer's resolved display color (§Timer colors).

### The Overdue visual

A count-*up* pie would be odd — the pie represents the draining *warning window*, which is meaningless once time is negative — so Overdue **drops the pie** and instead shows a **pulsing, escalated alert with a "LATE" tag and a count-up of how late it is** (e.g. `LATE +5s`): red, fast pulse, strong emphasis (candidate: screen-edge flash). It conveys that timing is lost and how overdue the ability now is; it disappears when ACT removes the timer (per that timer's `RemoveValue`). Exact styling is a tunable Phase 1 constant.

Lateness is `−TimeLeft`, read directly from ACT's (measured: unclamped, negative) reporting.

**No artificial floor.** The LATE alert lives exactly as long as ACT reports the overdue timer — its duration is the timer owner's `RemoveValue` choice, not an overlay constant. (An earlier design carried a ~2s minimum-display floor; live testing showed it made remove-at-0 timers display a phantom "LATE" the owner had explicitly configured away. Field-tested verdict: never outlive the data.) A reset is naturally instantaneous: the fresh frame's live reading replaces the LATE the moment ACT reports it.

### The center escalation zone

Model A moves escalated timers out of the list and toward center — but in a real raid several timers routinely cross their `WarningValue` in the same window, so this is the normal case, not an edge case, and the arrangement is a **Phase 1 design decision**, not a deferred one. All escalated elements — Imminent pies **and** Overdue LATE alerts — share one **center escalation zone**, arranged **most-urgent first** (Overdue ahead of Imminent, then soonest-to-expire). Provisional layout (a Phase 1 constant): a vertical stack anchored near screen-center, growing outward, capped at a small count. Overflow imminent timers (lowest priority) have already left the list conceptually, but with no center slot free they **wait as escalated/highlighted rows in the side list** — visually promoted, not yet centered — and move into the zone in most-urgent-first order as slots free. This keeps "one thing screaming" in the common single-escalation case while degrading sanely when several fire together, and it resolves where Overdue alerts sit relative to Imminent pies (same zone, ranked first). **Confirmed for Phase 1: a vertical stack** — chosen to get the state handling built; the arrangement is a swappable constant we can revisit later (horizontal row, one-big-plus-smaller, etc.). Each timer group has its own center zone (§Timer groups): escalated timers converge within their group, never across groups.

### Diagnostic logging (first-class Phase 1 feature)

Because the whole thing is one "read → diff → update" loop, tapping that loop yields a complete picture of ACT's behavior and our own. eq2auras writes **structured, timestamped diagnostics** (JSON-lines, BOM-less UTF-8) capturing per-timer readings and — especially — every state transition (calm→imminent→overdue, resets, removals), each with `TimeLeft` / `WarningValue` / `RemoveValue`. Records are group-aware: raw readings carry the panel-routing flags, and any per-group record (state transitions) names its timer group — a dual-flagged timer has two independent escalation states, and the log must distinguish them. It is toggleable so it is quiet in normal play. This log is both the mechanism for the verification spike (below) and a permanent debugging tool. **Volume & rotation:** normal play records **transitions only** (optionally plus low-rate sampled snapshots); the full per-tick dump is a **spike/verbose toggle**, not the default, since 30 fps × N timers grows fast. Logs write to an **app-data path on the Windows box** (`%APPDATA%\Advanced Combat Tracker\eq2auras\logs` — *not* a repo working tree; that machine has none), with a size/age cap and rotation so they cannot grow unbounded. **Retrieval to the Mac** (where analysis happens) is via a synced/shared folder or a manual copy — or, if the self-hosted-runner escape hatch is in use, the runner ferries logs out on each run since it already touches the Windows filesystem. Without a retrieval path the spike's findings are stranded on the machine that can't analyze them, so this is part of the spike's setup, not an afterthought. The repo's `.gitignore` entry for logs matters only once a log lands on the Mac.

### Baked-in constants for Phase 1

These are the values that become knobs later (promoted one at a time into `Settings` — see §Configuration). Phase 1 fixes them:
- List size, orientation, and sort (soonest-to-expire) — window *positions* are Settings knobs now (§Moving the overlay).
- Bar styling (fill alpha, font, spark — applied over the resolved display color).
- Center-pie size; pulse animation parameters.
- Overdue visual (count-up styling, flash).
- Poll/state tick rate.
- Target display & DPI: **primary monitor, system DPI** for Phase 1 (per-monitor DPI and monitor selection are later config; stated now to preempt WPF layered-window coordinate and click-through hit-testing bugs).
- Fallback when a timer has no usable `WarningValue` (`0`, or `≥` total): escalate at a **fraction of total duration** (e.g. the last 25%), not a fixed number of seconds — a fixed default would make a short timer permanently Imminent and scales badly across timer durations. If total duration is *also* unavailable, last-resort to an **absolute threshold** (e.g. the final 10s).

### Configuration: the knob model

Every tunable behavior is a **knob**: a typed value with a baked-in default, held in one plain `Settings` object in Core. The abstraction is deliberately thin — no framework, no reflection — but it is the single source of truth every later configuration phase builds on (per-timer overrides, the visual editor, import/export sharing strings all read/write the same store).

- **Store:** `Settings` (Core, pure, serializable) persisted to `%APPDATA%\Advanced Combat Tracker\eq2auras\settings.json` via `DataContractJsonSerializer` (never `System.Web.Extensions` — breaks the WPF markup compiler). Missing file or missing fields → defaults, so old settings files survive new knobs (forward-compatible).
- **Per-group settings:** `Settings.Panels` holds one `PanelSettings` per timer group — the group's knobs plus its four window-position values (list Left/Top, center-zone Left/Top). Positions are **nullable**: DCJS materializes missing numeric fields as `0` (a real screen corner), so `null` — never zero — means "unset, use the default layout". `Parse` normalizes the list to exactly the shipped two groups. **Legacy migration runs both directions:** an old flat file seeds Panel A from its top-level knobs (Panel B starts at defaults); on save, the top-level knobs are written mirroring Panel A, so an older build reading a newer file stays sensible.
- **Consumption:** Core policy (engine, tracker, builder, color assignment) takes the `Settings`/`PanelSettings` instance as input — keeping policy pure and Mac-testable. Renderers read display knobs the same way.
- **Surface:** minimal WinForms controls on the plugin's ACT tab, added per knob as needs arise — alongside the existing self-update controls (token entry, "check for updates"). Per-group knobs appear as one labeled control set per group ("Panel A" / "Panel B" group boxes) — no group selector. This is deliberately **not** the WeakAuras-style editor; that later phase edits the same `Settings`.
- **Current knobs (per group):** `ColorSource` — `Palette (default) | Greyscale | ActColor`; `EscalationStyle` — `CenterRadial (default) | HighlightInPlace`; the four window positions (set by dragging — §Moving the overlay). Everything still listed under *Baked-in constants* is a future knob awaiting promotion into `Settings`.

### Moving the overlay: unlock/move mode

The overlay windows are click-through by design, so repositioning needs an explicit mode — the WeakAuras "unlock frames" pattern. A **"Move overlay windows" checkbox on the plugin tab** unlocks every overlay window at once:

- **Unlocked:** each window clears `WS_EX_TRANSPARENT` and shows move chrome — a dashed outline, a translucent fill, and a label chip naming the window ("Panel A — list", "Panel B — escalation"). The chrome is also the hit-test surface: a transparent WPF window is mouse-invisible even without the click-through style, and the fill gives empty windows (a quiet list, an idle center zone) a visible, grabbable footprint. Dragging anywhere on the window moves it (`DragMove`).
- **Positions persist** into the group's `PanelSettings` on every drag-end and again on re-lock, so a crash while unlocked loses nothing. (Drag-end saves run on the overlay's STA thread while tab-knob saves run on ACT's UI thread — `SettingsStore.Save` serializes writers.)
- **Locked (default):** chrome hidden, click-through restored.
- Unlock shows **every** overlay window regardless of each group's `EscalationStyle` — a center zone unused under `HighlightInPlace` still shows its chrome and can be positioned before styles are flipped.

Positions are WPF device-independent units on the primary monitor (per the Phase 1 DPI stance). A null stored position means "use the built-in default layout": Panel A's windows where they have always been, Panel B's beside/below them, non-overlapping.

### Timer colors: session-stable palette assignment

ACT's per-timer `FillColor` is user data that overwhelmingly sits at the default blue, so it fails as a visual identity. Default color policy (`ColorSource = Palette`):

- A predefined palette of **5 distinguishable, pleasant colors** (a constant list in Core's `ColorPolicy.PaletteArgb`, mirrored for WPF by `OverlayTheme.Palette`; guild-approved, itself a future knob).
- **Color is keyed by normalized timer NAME — and nothing else.** The color's job is to identify *the ability as players think of it*, and the name is its stable proxy: the same ability cast by different boss variants (different `Combatant`s) or under zone-categorized trigger sets keeps one color. Keying by `(Name, Combatant)` or by category would recolor the same ability across boss versions/zones — exactly the confusion this feature exists to prevent. (If a user names zone-variant triggers differently, they get different colors — that's their expressed intent, fixable by renaming.)
- Assignment is **first-fired order**: the first time a name fires in the session it takes the next palette slot, and keeps it for the **plugin-instance lifetime** — stable across wipes, re-pulls, and boss versions. Consistency is a *repeated-attempts* feature; a plugin reload (i.e. taking an update) resetting the map is accepted (one-shot kills never needed consistency). Past 5 names the palette cycles. Explicitly per-ACT-instance; never synchronized across users. The map is also **global across timer groups** — one map per plugin instance, so a dual-flagged timer keeps one color in both panels (each group still applies its own `ColorSource` to the shared slot).
- **Display identity is unchanged** — rows/dedupe still key on `(Name, Combatant)`; two mobs casting the same ability get two rows that *share* the ability's color, which is correct under this model.
- `Greyscale` uses the same assignment mechanism over a grey ramp. `ActColor` restores the timer's own `FillColor` (with the slate-soften pass). Palette/greyscale colors are designed and render as-is.

### Explicitly out of scope for Phase 1

The configuration editor; per-timer / per-category customization; import/export sharing strings; element types beyond bar + radial; game icons/art; reading the combat log directly; group add/remove UI and non-panel routing sources (two ACT-panel-fed groups ship — §Timer groups); the Parse Meter module. All are later phases on the same core.

## Part III — Cross-cutting

### Development & test cycle

Development happens on **macOS** (with Claude); ACT and EQ2 run on a **separate Windows machine that stays a passive test target** — no build toolchain, no dev work, nothing installed beyond ACT and this plugin. That split is forced by one constraint and enabled by one architectural response.

**Constraint:** ACT plugins are Windows + .NET Framework only (WPF, .NET Framework, and ACT itself do not run on macOS). The build must happen on Windows — but not on the dev Mac (can't) and not on the personal Windows box (kept clean), so it happens in **cloud CI**.

**Project split** (the concrete form of the core/module architecture):
- **`eq2auras.Core`** — pure logic (state model, escalation rules, per-tick snapshot types, config). Target **.NET Standard 2.0**, so it **builds and unit-tests on the Mac** with `dotnet test`. Most TDD lives here.
- **`eq2auras.Plugin`** — the Windows-only shell (`IActPluginV1`, timer adapter, WPF overlay, self-updater). Target **.NET Framework 4.7.2**. **Compiles the Core sources into itself** (shared source — see Packaging) rather than referencing `Core.dll`, so the shipped plugin is one self-contained assembly. Compiles and runs only on Windows.

**Referencing ACT:** the plugin references `Advanced Combat Tracker.exe` itself (namespace `Advanced_Combat_Tracker`) via a relative `HintPath` with `SpecificVersion=False` and `Private=False` (not copied to output). The exe is committed to `ThirdParty/` in the **private** repo so CI can compile against it without redistribution concerns.

**Build & publish (CI):** a GitHub Actions `windows-latest` workflow, on push, runs **`msbuild`** (not `dotnet build` — WPF's XAML compile requires MSBuild) and publishes the built plugin as the asset of a rolling prerelease. The **version/tag is stamped by CI** (e.g. the run number or `git describe`), never by hand or from wall-clock in code.

**Single assembly by shared-source compilation** (see Packaging): the plugin csproj `<Compile Include>`s the Core sources, and CI ships exactly one `eq2auras.dll`. No ILRepack (with its netstandard→WPF merge hazards) and no runtime dependency resolution at all — the scan-safety property holds by construction and self-update moves one file.

**Deploy & reload (in-plugin self-update):** the intended mechanism (the `ACT_Adder` pattern) is: on startup or a "check for updates" action, a **background thread** (never `InitPlugin`'s thread — a GitHub call + download must not block ACT's UI at launch) queries the GitHub release; if newer, it downloads the DLL, strips the Windows mark-of-the-web (or ACT refuses to load it), overwrites the plugin file, and toggles `ActPluginData.cbEnabled` off→on. Needs no ACT-assigned plugin ID; works from an arbitrary URL.

**Re-enabling runs the new bytes — measured.** ACT loads plugin assemblies from bytes and **re-reads the file at enable-time**, so toggling `cbEnabled` after an overwrite runs the new build live (colour-coded-build test; see the Phase-0 resolved list above for the full evidence and the one open changed-`Core.dll` sub-case). No loader-plugin indirection and no restart-prompt is needed; the WPF payload reloads cleanly because ACT — not the plugin — performs the byte-loading.

**Token at rest:** downloading a **private** repo's release asset needs a GitHub token. Use a **fine-grained token scoped to this one repo, `contents:read` only** (never a classic repo-scoped PAT, which grants write to every private repo you own), **encrypted at rest with DPAPI** (`ProtectedData`, per-user) in the plugin's local config on the Windows box.

**The loop:** edit on Mac → `dotnet test` Core locally → push → CI builds & publishes → plugin self-updates in ACT **live, no restart** (a few minutes end to end — measured working). The fast inner loop is the local Core tests; the CI round-trip is only for the WPF/ACT shell, which can only be exercised on Windows anyway.

**Escape hatch (faster inner loop):** if the CI round-trip drags, a **self-hosted GitHub Actions runner** on the Windows box can build on push and copy the DLL straight into `%APPDATA%\Advanced Combat Tracker\Plugins` (~1–2 min, no fetch). It costs a background runner service on the personal machine, so it's opt-in, not the default. (Self-hosted runners must never run on a public repo.) This only skips the CI/network round-trip — it faces the **same DLL-lock and new-bytes-reload questions** as the self-updater (copying a file in no more runs new code live than the updater's overwrite does); it is not a shortcut around the reload problem.

**Teardown discipline** (see Platform facts) is what makes live reload safe: `DeInitPlugin()` must fully release windows, timers, event subscriptions, and log handles, or repeated hot-reloads leak.

### Testing strategy

- **Verification spike is the first implementation task.** A barebones plugin that subscribes to the four `OnSpellTimer*` events and polls `GetTimerFrames()`, writing the diagnostic log described above. Run it against synthetic timers and a real fight to *observe* — not guess — exactly: when ACT drops a frame (the `RemoveValue` behavior we inherit), whether `TimeLeft` goes negative or clamps at zero (which decides how the Overdue count-up is measured), and what a reset looks like in the data. This confirms the removal timing and the Overdue measurement. It also reports the **distribution of `WarningValue`** across the team's real timer set — validating the central premise that timers carry meaningful warning values before we build on it (if most lack one, escalation would flood the center via the fallback). The diagnostic-logging feature and this spike are the same code.
- **Reload validation (same early spike) — test that *new bytes execute*, not just that the lifecycle fires.** Bump a version constant, overwrite the DLL on disk, toggle `cbEnabled` off→on, and assert the **new version string is what's now running** (the decisive test). *Separately* confirm the toggle drives `DeInitPlugin()`→`InitPlugin()` cleanly with no leaked windows/timers/subscriptions — a distinct question that can pass while stale code still runs. Also test whether a separate dependent `Core.dll` blocks reload (the ILRepack premise) and settle the WPF thread model (ACT's UI thread vs. a dedicated STA `Dispatcher`). Because the payload is WPF, also confirm whether the loader-plugin fallback works at all with WPF resource/`pack://` resolution — if not (the expected outcome), restart-prompt is the WPF deploy path. Outcomes select: live self-update vs. loader-plugin vs. restart-prompt, and two-DLL vs. ILRepack (see Development & test cycle).
- **Synthetic timers for desk development.** We drive test timers without being in a raid — via ACT manual triggers and/or `FormSpellTimers.NotifySpell` — so the overlay can be developed and tuned at the desk.
- Standard unit tests for the state model / transition logic (pure functions over sequences of `(TimeLeft, WarningValue)` readings).

### Resolved by the Phase-0 spike (measured, 2026-07-01 — details in `docs/plans/2026-07-01-spike-findings.md`)

- **`SpellTimer.TimeLeft` is `int`** (whole seconds), `duration − elapsed`, **no clamp — goes negative after expiry** (observed `… 1 → 0 → −1`). Overdue lateness = `−TimeLeft` directly.
- **Removal timing — governed by the timer's own `RemoveValue` config.** The measured "~1s past zero" removal was a timer *configured* to remove at ~0 (initially misread as contradicting the `-15` default). Timers configured to linger keep reporting negative `TimeLeft` for their configured window. **Consequence: the overdue window is per-timer user config, inherited like `WarningValue` — the overlay shows LATE for exactly as long as ACT reports the timer, no floor.**
- **Events fire exactly as modeled**: `warning` at `tL = WarningValue`, `expire` at `tL = 0`; a **reset** appears as `TimeLeft` jumping back to full.
- **Live reload WORKS — no ACT restart.** Toggling the *existing* plugin entry's Enabled checkbox **re-reads the DLL from disk** (proof: ACT's own mark-of-the-web unblock prompt fires at enable time) and runs the new bytes — verified with a colour-coded build (green → overwrite → toggle → orange). The DLL is **not file-locked** while loaded (ACT byte-loads it), so overwrite-in-place works mid-session. **Self-update = the full ACT_Adder pattern: download → overwrite → toggle own `cbEnabled` → new version live.** The predicted WPF↔live-reload tension dissolved: ACT does the byte-loading, the plugin never calls `Assembly.Load(byte[])` itself. (Re-*adding* the plugin is a different code path and is rejected as a duplicate — updates go through the toggle, never Browse-add.) ACT does **not** probe the Plugins folder for a plugin's *dependencies*, and its pre-`InitPlugin` type scan resolves all field types — both facts drove the **single-assembly packaging** (see Packaging): with every type compiled into `eq2auras.dll`, no dependency resolution exists to go wrong, and self-update moves one file. (The two-DLL era's `AssemblyResolve`/byte-loading mechanics and the `LoadFrom` file-lock hazard are recorded in `docs/plans/2026-07-01-spike-findings.md`.)
- **WPF confirmed live over the game**: transparent, top-most, click-through, storyboard-animated, on a **dedicated STA thread + Dispatcher** — inside ACT's WinForms process. SDK-style `net472` + `UseWPF` builds in CI (no legacy csproj needed). One CI landmine: `System.Web.Extensions` breaks the WPF markup compiler — the self-updater must parse JSON without it.
- **Diagnostic logging is real-time**: ~109 ms measured poll cadence; JSONL is BOM-less UTF-8.

Still open (non-blocking, gathered during normal play / next phase):
- `SpellTimer.ExtraInfo` contents (per-instance identity for the feature plan — see below).
- `WarningValue` distribution across the team's real timer set (one timer type sampled so far).
- Whether ACT exposes a distinct warning color (irrelevant to us — we never inherit it).

**Surfaced by live data (and resolved in slice 2):** timers not bound to a caster report `Combatant = "none"`, so the `(Name, Combatant)` key cannot distinguish two concurrent instances of the same timer; concurrent instances share **one `TimerFrame`** whose `SpellTimers` is a list. The adapter snapshots **every** instance into readings, but display renders **one countdown per key: the soonest-expiring instance** — measured engine truth: ACT kills the whole frame when the soonest instance expires, so re-fires add instances that never outlive it, and the soonest is the only truthful countdown (matching ACT's native window; a newest-wins policy was tried and produced phantom countdowns).

### Roadmap (later phases, same core)

1. **Timer Overlay Phase 1** — this spec.
2. **Open the knobs** — *(started, on guild feedback: the knob model with `ColorSource` and `EscalationStyle` as the first knobs, now per-group with dragged window positions — see §Configuration, §Timer groups)* — expose the remaining baked-in constants, then per-timer / per-category overrides; a richer config surface (config strings, then an in-ACT editor with live preview) reading the same `Settings`; **group management** — add/remove timer groups and richer sources (category, name match) beyond the two ACT-panel-fed groups.
3. **Sharing** — import/export configuration strings, so overlay layouts travel the way timers do today.
4. **Richer elements** — more display types (icon w/ cooldown swipe, plain text, alternate bar styles), an intermediate "approaching" visual tier, animations.
5. **Hold overdue until reset** — optionally override ACT's `RemoveValue` removal so an overdue timer is *held and escalated* until the ability actually fires (a reset), for abilities a player must not lose track of. Deferred from Phase 1 (which keeps ACT's removal) because it reintroduces the cross-removal state model and a "never resets" escape hatch.
6. **Icons** — a name→icon mapping; possibly sourcing art from EQ2's own game files (never from live game memory).
7. **Parse Meter module** — replace ACT's "mini parse" window (combatant/DPS), on the same core via an encounter adapter.

### Open decisions

No open *design* decisions remain for Phase 1 — the two that were open are resolved:

> *Resolved — multiple simultaneous Imminent timers:* they arrange in the center escalation zone (see §The center escalation zone), most-urgent-first, as a **vertical stack** for Phase 1.

> *Resolved — overdue "escape hatch":* a non-issue for Phase 1 — an overdue timer disappears when ACT removes it at `RemoveValue`, exactly as ACT behaves today (the deferred "hold until reset" aspiration is in the roadmap).

The empirical questions that were open at design time — the reload/hot-swap mechanism and the packaging premise — are also resolved (§Resolved by the Phase-0 spike: live self-update proven, single-assembly packaging decided). All that remains open is the non-blocking list under *Still open*: `ExtraInfo` contents, `WarningValue` distribution, and ACT's warning-color question.
